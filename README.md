# Plotly-Biodiversity
<br>
For this project, I created a site that takes in data using D3 and generates a bubble chart and bar chart using Plotly based on user selection from a dropdown menu. In order to do this, several functions were created and an event listener was used on the dropdown menu to respond to user input on change. In order to run the page properly, please make sure you have access to the samples.json, app.js, and index.html files on the repo.
